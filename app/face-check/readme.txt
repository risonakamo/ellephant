-checking tools for faces
-each face image's filename is the api_id of a ship from the api_start2 object
-call the function in apiship-id-name-hook.js on the api_mst_ship in api_start2,
which will hook names of ships and display all the ids of a ship with each name
-the json output by this represents the "right answer"
-put the json output into face-check.html to get visual output
-check chrome error log for missing face images
-make sure images match up with the name

-although labels pad numbers with 0 file names SHOULD NOT HAVE 0
